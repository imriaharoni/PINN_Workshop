Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)Technical Description for 1D Heat Equation ImplementationPINN Architecture:* Neural Network type: Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)* Inputs: spatial coordinate (x), temporal coordinate (t)* Output: predicted temperature u(x, t)* Activation: typically tanh* Typical structure:o Input layer: 2 neurons (x, t)o Hidden layers: multiple layers with neurons typically 64Ð128 eacho Output layer: 1 neuron (u)PINN Formulation (Loss Function):PINNs minimize a combined loss function, consisting of three core terms:1. Physics Loss (PDE Residual):L_Physics = (1/N_f) * sum_i[ (u_t(x_i, t_i) - alpha * u_xx(x_i, t_i))^2 ]* Evaluated at randomly sampled collocation points (x_i, t_i) within the spatial-temporal domain.2. Initial Condition Loss:L_IC = (1/N_IC) * sum_i[ (u(x_i, 0) - f(x_i))^2 ]* Ensures network predictions at initial time match known initial conditions f(x).3. Boundary Condition Loss:L_BC = (1/N_BC) * sum_i[ u(0, t_i)^2 + u(L, t_i)^2 ]* Enforces boundary conditions (typically zero temperature at the boundaries).Total Loss minimized:L_Total = L_Physics + L_IC + L_BC* Optionally, experimental or sparse observational data can be added as an additional loss term to enhance accuracy.Key Computational Technique:Automatic Differentiation (AutoDiff):* Utilized to exactly compute derivatives (u_t, u_xx), ensuring stable and accurate PDE residual evaluations.* Implemented using neural network frameworks such as PyTorch or TensorFlow.Training Methodology:* Optimization via gradient-based methods (e.g., Adam optimizer).* Training performed using randomly sampled batches of points within the domain for efficiency and generalization.* Iterative minimization of the combined loss function until convergence.Evaluation and Metrics:* Commonly used error metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or L2 Norm.* Stability and convergence compared against analytical solutions or robust numerical methods (e.g., Finite Difference Method (FDM)).Implementation Outline (Step-by-step coding instructions):1.
